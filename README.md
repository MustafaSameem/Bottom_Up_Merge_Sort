# IterativeMergeSort
This project sorts values in ascending order
User can input their own values or decide to make a list of random generated numbers to be sorted

The approach used is an iterative bottom up merge sort as opposed to the regular top down recursive merge sort.
A circular queue is used to store "runs" which allows the program to be iterative.
